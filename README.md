# Vibrant Linux

vibrant linux is a gui tool that serves the same purpose as vibrance gui on windows.

It currently only supports nvidia as I have yet to find a way to tweak saturation/vibrance on amd, and intel gpus. If you find a way to adjust saturation/vibrace on amd, intel, or any other gpu brand that I never heard of please create an issue with the method of how to adjust saturation and it will be added to the program.

Trust me, I'm more digusted with myself than anyone could be for writing software that only supports nvidia.
